## üñ•Ô∏è Technology Stack

The below showcases the collection of open-source solutions currently implemented in the cluster. Each of these components has been meticulously documented, and their deployment is managed using FluxCD, which adheres to GitOps principles.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) has played a crucial role in the development and popularization of many of these tools, driving the adoption of cloud-native technologies and enabling projects like this one to thrive.
